# _Dev Diary_

## **_About Me_**

Hi! I'm a software engineer in progress with a curious mind and a deep love for understanding how things work. I enjoy exploring the hidden structure beneath systems, how they’re built, how they function, and what makes them tick.

I’m interested in both creativity and logic, and I like working on things that let me use both. I care about clarity and expression, whether I’m solving a problem or designing something. My work isn’t limited to one field; I enjoy exploring different areas like algorithms, visual tools, or anything that piques my interest.

I don’t always build with a clear end in mind, sometimes it’s just about experimenting, learning, or trying to model an idea. This [GitHub][1] serves mostly as a personal archive: an evolving collection of small projects, half-formed ideas, and things I’ve learned along the way.

I’m still exploring where I want to go, but I know it’ll involve thoughtful systems, honest work, and a touch of creative weirdness.

## [_Good Developer Mindset Keypoints_](https://www.bomberbot.com/software-development/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes/)

- There's always something new to learn.

  - You can always grow to be better with hard work.

- Divide and conquer complex tasks. <br />

- Debuggin is an invistigation. Being open minded, asking the right questions, using the right tools, and looking for clues are all essential to carrying out a good one.

- The value of your project lies in the end product, less in the implementation.

- Always start with the simplest solution.

- Study your porject requirments and makes decisions that are the most advantagous.

- The most readable code is better for future maintainability than a complex but clever solution.

- Keep predictable future changes in mind when designing your product.

- Feedback is part of the development process.

- Good teamwork makes the development process smoohter.

- Design practices like modularity can be utalized to manage complexity.

- Deeply understanding how your code works is important for development and debugging.

- Some repitive tasks can be automated, saving valuable time that can be used for development.

- Writing a solid solution that works but is lacking in some form is better than never releasing anything at all.
